 # Introduction

Today, the internet is used everywhere, but it is also full of dangers. Hackers try to steal personal and business data using different tricks. This report explains common cybersecurity threats and how we can stay safe.

# Common Cybersecurity Threats

## Phishing Attacks

Phishing happens when hackers send fake emails or messages to trick people into sharing personal information like passwords or bank details.

Example:

Fake emails that look like they are from a bank, asking for login details.


## Malware & Ransomware

Malware is a harmful software that can damage computers or steal data. Ransomware locks your files and demands money to unlock them.

Example:

In 2017, a ransomware attack called WannaCry affected many computers worldwide.


## DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attacks

DDoS attacks send too much traffic to a website, making it slow or stopping it from working.

Example:

Hackers use botnets (infected computers) to flood a website with too many requests.


## Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

This attack happens when hackers secretly listen to communication between two people or systems to steal information.

Example:

A hacker listens to your login details when you use public Wi-Fi.


## Insider Threats

Sometimes, people inside a company leak or misuse company data.

Example:

A company employee steals and sells secret business information.
